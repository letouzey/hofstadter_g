QuantumLib is a Coq library for reasoning about quantum programs. It was co-developed with (and is used in) several other projects in inQWIRE including [QWIRE](https://github.com/inQWIRE/QWIRE), [SQIR](https://github.com/inQWIRE/SQIR), and [VyZX](https://github.com/inQWIRE/VyZX).

## Compilation

QuantumLib is currently compatible with Coq 8.16 -- 8.19.

This project requires `opam` & `dune` to be installed.

Install `dune` using `opam install dune`

To compile run `make all`.

Stable versions of QuantumLib may be installed using `opam install coq-quantumlib`

## Using With Other Projects

### Official Release

To install the official release of QuantumLib, run the following.
```
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam update
opam install coq-quantumlib
```

### Dev

To install the development version of QuantumLib, run `opam pin coq-quantumlib https://github.com/inQWIRE/QuantumLib.git`. This should allow you to import QuantumLib files into other Coq files. To pull subsequent updates, run `opam install coq-quantumlib`. When importing/exporting specific files, refer to QuantumLib files as `QuantumLib.FILENAME`.
